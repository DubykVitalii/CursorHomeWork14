Lately
sleep
Dreaming
the
things
that
could
But
baby
prayin'
hard
Said
more
counting
dollars
We'll
counting
stars
Yeah
we'll
counting
stars
see
this
life
Like
swinging
vine
Swing
heart
across
the
line
face
flashing
signs
Seek
out
and
shall
find
Old
but
I'm
not
that
old
Young
but
I'm
not
that
bold
And
don't
think
the
world
sold
I'm
just
doing
what
we're
told
feel
something
right
doing
the
wrong
thing
And
feel
something
wrong
doing
the
right
thing
couldn't
couldn't
couldn't
Everything
that
kills
makes
feel
alive
Lately
sleep
Dreaming
the
things
that

But
baby
prayin'
hard
Said

Down
